iQUIK on a NewWorld
===================

Parition-zero booting on OF 3.0 is not supported. Had Apple
made NewWorlds fully CHRP-compatible, then you should have
been able to boot like 'hd:%BOOT', similar to QEMU with
OpenBIOS.

However, iquik.elf can be booted the same way as yaboot. Put it on a
an HFS+ partition of type Apple_Bootstrap, and bless the image.

$ hattrib -t tbxi -c UNIX iquik.elf

Of course, boot-file needs to point to the disk:part containing
the configuration and boot files.

You can also boot directly (here, from a USB2 drive).

0 > boot ud:,\iquik.elf

You can boot from:
* USB (avoid USB3 drives...they likely won't work!)
* Internal IDE HD
* CD
